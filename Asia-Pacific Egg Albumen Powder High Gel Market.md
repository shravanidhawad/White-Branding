Egg whites are known for their ability to form stable foams, which can enhance the leavening process in baked goods, resulting in lighter, fluffier textures. The market for egg albumen powder in bakery applications is growing due to the increasing demand for high-quality, functional ingredients that improve the nutritional profile of bakery products. As consumers continue to favor healthier options, the high protein content of egg albumen powder aligns well with the shift towards functional foods. Moreover, egg albumen powder can help maintain consistency in mass production, making it a reliable ingredient for large-scale bakeries.<h3>Meat</h3><p>Egg albumen powder is increasingly being used in the meat industry as a binding agent, fat replacer, and stabilizer. It is particularly popular in processed meats such as sausages, burgers, and ready-to-eat meals, where it helps to improve texture, moisture retention, and overall product stability. The growth in the Asia–Pacific region’s meat industry, particularly in emerging economies, is driving the demand for egg albumen powder. As consumers demand healthier, more nutritious meat products, egg albumen powder offers a clean-label solution, with minimal additives and preservatives. Additionally, its ability to enhance product yield and prevent the separation of fat during processing makes it an essential ingredient for manufacturers seeking to create high-quality processed meats with improved mouthfeel and appearance.<h3>Other Applications</h3><p>Beyond the primary applications in confectionery, bakery, and meat products, egg albumen powder is used in a variety of other food and non-food industries. In the food sector, it serves as a stabilizing agent in sauces, dressings, and beverages, where its emulsifying properties are highly valued. It is also utilized in the production of protein powders, meal replacements, and health supplements. Outside the food industry, egg albumen powder is used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and even in certain industrial applications, including adhesives and coatings.
